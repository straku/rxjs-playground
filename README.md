# RxJS Playground

Implementation of tutorial [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) by [@andrestaltz](https://twitter.com/andrestaltz).

Sprinkled with some React to see how well it plays with RxJS. Slightly modified and using RxJS 5.0. Pretty big bundle for such a tiny app but I'm importing whole RxJS for the sake of simplicity, if you want you can import basic functionality and specific operators, learn more from RxJS [docs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs#installation-and-usage).

Design shamelessly stolen from [Twitter](https://twitter.com).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
